Question 3:
Nth node from end of linked list 
Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. 
The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end os 8.  


class GfG
{
    //Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
    int getNthFromLast(Node head, int n)
    {
    	// Your code here	
    	int l=0,y=1;
    	Node current = head;
    	while(current!=null)
    	{
    	    current = current.next;
    	    l++;
    	}
    	if(n>l){
    	    return -1;
    	}
    	int x=l-n+1;
    	current=head;
    	while(x!=y){
    	    current=current.next;
    	    y++;
    	}
    	return current.data;
    }
}
